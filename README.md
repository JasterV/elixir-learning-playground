# Elixir playground

Here I'm just going to add small tests & exercises that I'm doing on my way to learn Elixir.

I'm starting first from the very basics of the language and my goal is to end up building a fullstack application using `Phoenix`.

If you already know elixir this is probably not useful to you in any way.
If you are curious about what is Elixir and how does it look like, here you will find (at least for now) some very basic code from a beginner like me :smile:
